# Simple KNN Classifier

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

A small AI project that uses the k-nearest neighbors algorithm to classify points in a simple dataset. Easy to understand and a good start for learning machine learning.

## Background

Classifying data points is a common task in AI. This project shows how KNN works on a simple example dataset. It helps beginners learn about training and testing data and model accuracy.

## How is it used?

The program trains on some data points and predicts the class of new points based on their nearest neighbors. Users can try different values of k to see how it affects accuracy.

## Data sources and AI methods

Data is generated with `make_moons` from scikit-learn. KNN algorithm is used for classification.

## Challenges

This project is limited to simple data and doesnâ€™t solve real-world problems. It is mainly for learning purposes.

## What next?

Try other machine learning methods and bigger datasets to improve understanding.
